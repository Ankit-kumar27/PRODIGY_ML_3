# PRODIGY_ML_3
A machine learning project classifying cat and dog images using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. The model is optimized using GridSearchCV and evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score metrics.

--Features
Image Preprocessing: Automatic resizing and grayscale conversion.

Feature Extraction: Uses HOG descriptors for robust image features.

Model Training: Trains an SVM classifier, searching for best parameters (C and kernel).

Performance Metrics: Reports accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction Utility: Script for classifying new images.

Visualization: Includes functions for visualizing HOG features and prediction results.
